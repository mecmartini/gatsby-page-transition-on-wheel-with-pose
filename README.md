# Example of using React-Pose with Gatsby for page transitions

A fork of the official Gatsby Starter Default v2 with added simple page transitions using Popmotion's React-Pose.

## Heavily inspired by

- [Route transitions with Reach Router](https://popmotion.io/pose/learn/route-transitions-reach-router/)
- [Official Gatsby example using-page-transitions](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-page-transitions)
